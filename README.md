# Qtris

Simulator of the Qtris game with Python generated GUI (Graphical User Interface). The GUI is based on the Python package tkinter (https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

To execute the simulator the suggested steps to follow are: 

1) Download a conda installer (https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html)
2) Create a conda environment containing a Python interpreter (conda env -n <name> python)
3) Activate the conda environment (conda activate <name>)
4) Install tkinter and numpy in the conda environment (pip install numpy, tk)
5) Go to the directory containing the Python simulator with the terminal (cd <PATH>)
6) Execute the simulator (python <simulator_name>.py)
